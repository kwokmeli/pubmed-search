## PubMed Search

### About
With PubMed Search, you can browse the PubMed database for articles. Ask Alexa for information about the article - abstract, publication dates, authors, journal titles, and more! Linking your Google account will allow you to select articles for Alexa to send to your e-mail.

### Usage
To ask for search for articles:
- "Search for diabetes.", "Give me articles about kuru.", "Find articles about lung cancer.", "Look for dentistry.", etc. You can search for new articles at any time.

To select an article:
- "Article 10.", "Number 8.", etc. You can select a new article at any time.

To learn more about a selected article:
- "Give me the authors.", "Who is the author?", "Tell me the abstract.", "What is the PubMed ID?", etc. Article features you can ask about include PubMed ID, title, date, author, ISSN, issue, volume, and abstract.

To e-mail the selected article to yourself:
- "Send mail." or "Send."

### Known Issues
- Incorrect formatting/information for book articles (articles from books, or entire books themselves). Oftentimes, the XML sent for articles from books is sparse and does not include all relevant information.

### Future Additions
- Make database searches using [PubMed's Advanced Search Builder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced) - add boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and fields (Author, Editor, Filter, Grant Number, Publisher, etc.) to your search query.
- Better e-mail formatting.
